# Coalescence
This is a repo for a game made for the final project of a Game Development class at University of Idaho. It's not meant to be anything realeased. Mainly putting it here so it shows up on my commit activity. And GitLab is super slow. 

## Running It
Clone/download it, `cd` to its directory and run `./gradlew run`.

## Premise
**Coalescence** is a game that approaches the roll of death in a nonstandard way. Rather than death being an endpoint for the player, or something the player attempts to avoid, **Coalescence** will have the player start again after death, but play with a new character alongside characters from all previous attempts. The player will be expected to work with themselves, both in their previous actions and planning ahead for future actions as well.

## Game Rules
- The Player controls one character at a time
- The Player’s actions are recorded
- The Player will not be able to interact with previous characters, so as not to disturb the timeline
- Upon death, The Player can no longer control or interact with that character.
- Upon death, The Player assumes control of a new character
- The Player’s character will have a finite amount of health, and can be damaged by enemies and projectiles.
- The Player’s character will be able to deal damage to other enemy entities.
- The Player’s goal is to get through the level, clearing a path to the end with each iteration of play.
